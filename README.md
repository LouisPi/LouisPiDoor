# Louis Pi Door Opening Code

The code uses a keypad to allow the user to enter a code. If the code matches the one preset access is granted by turning a small SG90 servo from the middle (locking a model door)to the max (allowing a model door to open). All text is shown on a 128 x 64 SSD1306 i2c OLED. Big thanks to Brett McLean (the creator of the pad4pi python library) for all the keypad code (https://github.com/brettmclean/pad4pi/blob/develop/rpi_gpio_demo2.py) and to Tony DiCola (Adafruit Industried) for the OLED code (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306).
